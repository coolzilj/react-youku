## Installation

The easiest way to use react-youku is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-youku.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install react-youku --save
```
